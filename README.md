# React Native AsyncStorage Deprecation and Improved Data Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications involving the deprecated `AsyncStorage` and provides a solution using a more robust alternative.  The original code uses `AsyncStorage` to store and retrieve data, leading to potential errors and performance issues, especially with larger datasets.  The solution shows how to migrate to a more suitable data storage mechanism.

## Problem

`AsyncStorage` is deprecated and prone to issues with large data volumes. The original code lacks comprehensive error handling, making it unreliable.

## Solution

The solution replaces `AsyncStorage` with a more reliable alternative, such as SQLite or MMKV, and incorporates better error handling and data management techniques. The improved code is efficient and resilient, handling issues associated with large datasets and concurrent access.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run the app using your preferred React Native development environment
