In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, a common issue is encountering the error `AsyncStorage has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release`. This occurs because AsyncStorage is now considered outdated and unreliable for large-scale applications.  It is particularly problematic for storing large amounts of data. Here's a code example demonstrating improper AsyncStorage usage and the subsequent error:

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const storeData = async (key, value) => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Failed to store data:', e);
  }
};

const getData = async (key) => {
  try {
    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem(key);
    return jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : null;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Failed to get data:', e);
  }
};
```

This code might work for small applications but can cause issues in larger projects. For instance, there's no error handling for storing large JSON objects or managing concurrent data access.
